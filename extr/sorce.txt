I’ve created two bots, both named after Morgan from One Piece, who’s that famous news bird. The idea is to build an anime news network where each bot has its own job.

The first bot is the main head or the “face” of Morgan -> @MorgansNews_Bot. This is the bot users will interact with — it handles things like upvotes and general communication. In the future, once posts get enough upvotes, this bot will also start forwarding news from our Anime News Ocean channel to other groups and channels to spread our updates even further.

The second bot @Moragans_NewsBot works more in the background. Its main job is to fetch and forward posts from other source channels into our Anime News Ocean channel. It also has a smart rule: if a post has a long caption, it won’t send it directly to our main channel. Instead, it forwards it to a special channel called Nyuzu'ku(@dfsfdfsddgsrg).

We, the admins, will check each post that lands in Nyuzu'ku, and we must shorten the text and translate it into English — that’s mandatory. The reason is to keep everything brief, clean, and in English for our main audience.

Here’s the step-by-step process for what to do:

1. Forward the message from Nyuzu'ku to our main Morgan bot (the first bot).

2. The bot will then send back that message, hiding the original sender’s name, so it’s neat.

3. Now, copy all the text from that post, and paste it into Google Translate (or any translator) to convert it to English.

4. After translating, you should summarize or shorten it, maybe using ChatGPT or whatever tool you like, so it’s crisp and to the point.

5. Then, go back to the same post you forwarded to the bot, reply to it, and use the /edit command.

6. The bot will automatically generate our usual caption format.

7. The bot will give you only the text. Copy that text, edit the same post again, paste this clean caption, and finally forward it to our Anime News Ocean channel.

And that’s it — a simple process to make sure everything we post is short, translated, and perfectly formatted.

That’s basically how the whole system works — two bots sharing the same Morgan identity, each handling a different part of the news flow, to keep everything organized and ensure our audience always gets clean, well-translated anime news.
